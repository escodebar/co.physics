## Computerorientierte Physik - Universit√§t Bern ##
The course is aimed to provide students with a basic knowledge of C programming language and of its employment to address physics related questions such as numerical integration, solution of differential equation, Monte Carlo method for simulation of physical processes. The course will consist of three hours per week, one hour of theory and two hours of exercises. The students are not expected to have any background in programming.
